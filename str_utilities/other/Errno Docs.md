For example, you should not necessarily expect to be able to use NS addresses with ARPA Internet protocols.                                                                                                                |
| 48          | EADDRINUSE      | Address already in use. Only one usage of each address is normally permitted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 49          | EADDRNOTAVAIL   | Cannot assign requested address. Normally results from an attempt to create a socket with an address not on this machine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 50          | ENETDOWN        | Network is down. A socket operation encountered a dead network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 51          | ENETUNREACH     | Network is unreachable. A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 52          | ENETRESET       | Network dropped connection on reset. The host you were connected to crashed and rebooted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 53          | ECONNABORTED    | Software caused connection abort. A connection abort was caused internal to your host machine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 54          | ECONNRESET      | Connection reset by peer. A connection was forcibly closed by a peer. This normally results from a loss of the connection on the remote socket due to a timeout or a reboot.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 55          | ENOBUFS         | No buffer space available. An operation on a socket or pipe was not performed because the system lacked sufficient buffer space or because a queue was full.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 56          | EISCONN         | Socket is already connected. A connect(2) request was made on an already connected socket; or, a sendto(2) or sendmsg(2) request on a connected socket specified a destination when already connected.                                                                                                                                    |
| 57          | ENOTCONN        | Socket is not connected. An request to send or receive data was disallowed because the socket was not connected and (when sending on a datagram socket) no address was supplied.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 58          | ESHUTDOWN       | Cannot send after socket shutdown. A request to send data was disallowed because the socket had already been shut down with a previous shutdown(2) call.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 60          | ETIMEDOUT       | Operation timed out. A connect(2) or send(2) request failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time. (The timeout period is dependent on the communication protocol.)                                                                                                                                 |
| 61          | ECONNREFUSED    | Connection refused. No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it. This usually results from trying to connect to a service that is inactive on the foreign host.                                                                                                                                            |
| 62          | ELOOP           | Too many levels of symbolic links. A path name lookup involved more than 32 (MAXSYMLINKS) symbolic links.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 63          | ENAMETOOLONG    | File name too long. A component of a path name exceeded {NAME_MAX} characters, or an entire path name exceeded {PATH_MAX} characters. (See also the description of _PC_NO_TRUNC in pathconf(2).)                                                                                                                                          |
| 64          | EHOSTDOWN       | Host is down. A socket operation failed because the destination host was down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 65          | EHOSTUNREACH    | No route to host. A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable host.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 66          | ENOTEMPTY       | Directory not empty. A directory with entries other than `.' and `..' was supplied to a remove directory or rename call.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 68          | EUSERS          | Too many users. The quota system ran out of table entries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 69          | EDQUOT          | Disc quota exceeded. A write(2) to an ordinary file, the creation of a directory or symbolic link, or the creation of a directory entry failed because the user's quota of disk blocks was exhausted, or the allocation of an inode for a newly created file failed because the user's quota of inodes was exhausted.                     |
| 70          | ESTALE          | Stale NFS file handle. An attempt was made to access an open file (on an NFS file system) which is now unavailable as referenced by the file descriptor. This may indicate the file was deleted on the NFS server or some other catastrophic event occurred.                                                                              |

| EAGAIN          | Resource temporarily unavailable                  | The call might work if you try again later. The macro @code{EWOULDBLOCK} is another name for @code{EAGAIN}; they are always the same in @theglibc{}. This error can happen in a few different situations: @itemize @bullet @item An operation that would block was attempted on an object that has non-blocking mode selected. Trying the same operation again will block until some external condition makes it possible to read, write, or connect (whatever the operation). You can use @code{select} to find out when the operation will be possible; @pxref{Waiting for I/O}. @strong{Portability Note:} In many older Unix systems, this condition was indicated by @code{EWOULDBLOCK}, which was a distinct error code different from @code{EAGAIN}. To make your program portable, you should check for both codes and treat them the same. @item A temporary resource shortage made an operation impossible. @code{fork} can return this error. It indicates that the shortage is expected to pass, so your program can try the call again later and it may succeed. It is probably a good idea to delay for a few seconds before trying it again, to allow time for other processes to release scarce resources. Such shortages are usually fairly serious and affect the whole system, so usually an interactive program should report the error to the user and return to its command loop. @end itemize |
| EINPROGRESS     | Operation now in progress                         | An operation that cannot complete immediately was initiated on an object that has non-blocking mode selected.

Instead, they return @code{EINPROGRESS} to indicate that the operation has begun and will take some time. Attempts to manipulate the object before the call completes return @code{EALREADY}.

| ENOTSUP         | Not supported                                     | A function returns this error when certain parameter values are valid, but the functionality they request is not available. This can mean that the function does not implement a particular command or option value or flag bit at all. For functions that operate on some object given in a parameter, such as a file descriptor or a port, it might instead mean that only @emph{that specific object} (file descriptor, port, etc.) is unable to support the other parameters given; different file descriptors might support different ranges of parameter values. If the entire function is not available at all in the implementation, it returns @code{ENOSYS} instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| EIEIO           | Computer bought the farm                          | Go home and have a glass of warm, dairy-fresh milk. Okay. Since you are dying to know, I'll tell you. This is a joke, obviously. There is a children's song which begins, "Old McDonald had a farm, e-i-e-i-o." Every time I see the (real) errno macro EIO, I think about that song. Probably most of my compatriots who program on Unix do, too. One of them must have stayed up a little too late one night and decided to add it to Hurd or Glibc. Whoever did it should be castigated, but it made me laugh. --jtobey@channel1.com "bought the farm" means "died". -jtobey Translators, please do not translate this litteraly, translate it into an idiomatic funny way of saying that the computer died.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
